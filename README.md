# Health Geographer and Population Researcher

## About Me
As a health geographer and spatial data scientist, I am motivated to explore the relationships between geography, health, and society. I am fascinated by the social and physical environments that shape health and well being. 
By adopting a spatial perspective and utilizing a range of quantitative methods — from GIS techniques to Bayesian models to spatial and non-spatial statistics – my work advances the incorporation of the geographic perspective in population health research and contributes to understanding health disparities. My scholarly work encompasses a broad range of domains, including public health, the influence of neighborhoods on health, social determinants of health, climate change and health, and climate gentrification.
Currently, as a PhD candidate in the Geography Department at Florida State University my research has been broadly focused on investigating the impact of social and built environments on health and well-being. This work has offered insights into the disparities in life expectancy linked to social determinant of health, the impact of COVID-19 on U.S. nursing homes, the implications of differential privacy on the calculation of small area health metrics, and the potential displacement risks in communities facing climate gentrification.
