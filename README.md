## About Me
As a health geographer and spatial data scientist, I am motivated to explore the relationships between geography, health, and society. I am fascinated by the social and physical environments that shape health and well being. 

By adopting a spatial perspective and utilizing a range of quantitative methods — from GIS techniques to Bayesian models to spatial and non-spatial statistics – my work advances the incorporation of the geographic perspective in population health research and contributes to understanding health disparities. My scholarly work encompasses a broad range of domains, including public health, the influence of neighborhoods on health, social determinants of health, climate change and health, and climate gentrification.

Currently, as a PhD candidate in the Geography Department at Florida State University my research has been broadly focused on investigating the impact of social and built environments on health and well-being (See my CV here: [CV](image/CV1.pdf)). This work has offered insights into the disparities in life expectancy linked to social determinant of health, the impact of COVID-19 on U.S. nursing homes, the implications of differential privacy on the calculation of small area health metrics, and the potential displacement risks in communities facing climate gentrification.

## Example Projects

### Locating Neighborhood Displacement Risks to Climate Gentrification Pressures in Three Coastal Counties in Florida
#### Highlights
·    Over the next few decades, residents in vulnerable communities may be subject to second-order displacement, via in-movers pricing longtime residents out of their homes and neighborhoods.

·    Areas that have the highest risk of gentrification-driven displacement based on demographic, socioeconomic, and housing factors tend to be inland in Florida.

·    This study uses the well-known principal components analysis (PCA) to create synthetic displacement factors to construct an index to categorize neighborhoods as being at potentially high, medium, or low risk for second-order displacement.
