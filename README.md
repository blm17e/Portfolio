# Health Geographer and Population Researcher

## About Me
As a health geographer and spatial data scientist, I'm deeply motivated to explore the intricate relationships between geography, health, and society. My fascination lies in how social and physical environments shape health outcomes and well-being. Leveraging a spatial perspective and employing a diverse array of quantitative methods—from GIS techniques and Bayesian models to both spatial and non-spatial statistics—my work emphasizes the importance of geographic perspectives in population health research and seeks to deepen the understanding of health disparities. My scholarly pursuits span several domains, including public health, neighborhood impacts on health, social determinants of health, climate change effects on health, and climate gentrification. 

As a Ph.D. candidate in the Geography Department at Florida State University, my research primarily focuses on the impact of social and built environments on health and well-being, providing insights into life expectancy disparities, COVID-19's impact on U.S. nursing homes, the implications of differential privacy on small area health metrics, and potential displacement risks in communities facing climate gentrification.
